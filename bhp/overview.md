# Introduction

## What is BHPï¼Ÿ
The BHP network is a set of open-source blockchain projects.

## BHP CLI

`bhpcli` is a command-line interface that lets you interact with the BHP. `bhpcli` is the only tool that supports 100% of the BHP features, including accounts, transfers, delegation, and governance. Learn more about `bhpcli` with the [delegator's CLI guide](../delegators/delegators-guide-cli.html).

## Running a full-node on the BHP Testnet

In order to run a full-node for the BHP testnet, you must first [install `bhpd`](../getting-start/install-bhp.html). Then, follow [the guide](../getting-start/install-bhp.html).

If you are looking to run a validator node, follow the [validator setup guide](../validators/validators-guide-cli.html).
