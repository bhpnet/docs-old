# Basic Concepts

## BHP Node Types

### Full Node
A full node is a program that verifies blockchain transactions and blocks. Unlike lightweight nodes that only process block headers and a small number of transactions, it requires more resources to run full nodes, which is a necessary step to become a proposer. In addition, full nodes can also be used to provide stable and low latency blockchain APIs for applications.

### Validator Node
The role of a validator is to exercise block generation rights and enjoy on-chain governance rights. In a voting session, 21 nodes that have obtained the highest numbers of votes from okt voters are elected as vaildator in the next cycle.

### Validator Candidate Node
Only top 21 bonded full nodes can become validator nodes, the rest will become candidates. The situation will change as delegation amount changes.

## BHP User Types

### Normal User

A normal user is an BHP holder.

### Validator Operator
A validator operator is the only one who can operate the Validator's informations or participate in governance as the validator.

### Delegator

Delegators are BHP holders who cannot, or do not want to run a validator themselves. BHP holders can delegate BHP to a validator and obtain a part of their revenue in exchange. They can earn as much as the validators and only need to pay some commission.
